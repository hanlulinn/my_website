# Task 1: Short biography written using markdown

## Brief Biography

My name is **Hanlu Lin**. I was born in China, Fujian province, lying in the southeastern part of China. I studied in *Fuzhou No.1 High school* in Fuzhou, and then studied my bachelor degree in *Hong Kong*, majoring in Hotel Management and Finance.

Before I applied to London Business School for the MAM program, I have several internship experience as follows:\
1. Business Analyst in [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/en-us)  
2. Strategic Consultant in [Kantar Consulting](https://www.kantar.com/expertise/consulting)  
3. Analyst in [Jones Lang LaSalle](https://internationalresidential.jll.com.hk/)

From the internship experience, I decided to dig deeper into the business analytics fields. And I applied for the master degree in **London Business School**, which is a renowned business school with such beautiful campus ![campus](http://prod-upp-image-read.ft.com/e161f29e-cf1d-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc) located in London.I very much look forward to my study life there in London Business School for the coming years.

Given these trends, we can find that most of the countries in Asia, including China, have a stable increase of life expectancy since 1952. And there shows a slowdown in the growth of life expectancy in Asian countries from 1980. Among all continents, all of the 5 continents shows growth in life expectancy over years from 1951. The growth rate of life expectancy in Asia is higher than that in continents like Afria, Europe and Oceania. So that we can tell that the development of economics,culture and medical treatement in those develeoping countries in Asia since 1952 is in a more rapid pace, comparing to those developed countries in Europe.

My analysis shows that the proportion of native born residents in a constituency and its leave share are positively correlated. With more proportion of native born residents in the constituency, the leave share of the constituency is higher, which is to say, in those constituencies that containing more natives, people are more tend to support the Brexit, with the fear of immigration and opposition to the EU's more open border policy.

# Task 4: Animal rescue incidents attended by the London Fire Brigade

  # mutate adds a new column; here we calculate the percentage
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2)) %>% 
  
  # arrange() sorts the data by percent. Since the default sorting is min to max and we would like to see it sorted
  # in descending order (max to min), we use arrange(desc()) 
  arrange(desc(percent))


animal_rescue %>% 
  
  #count does the same thing as group_by and summarise
  # name = "count" will call the column with the counts "count" ( exciting, I know)
  # and 'sort=TRUE' will sort them from max to min
  count(animal_group_parent, name="count", sort=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(percent = round(100*count/sum(count),2))


```

> Please note that any cost included is a notional cost calculated based on the length of time rounded up to the nearest hour spent by Pump, Aerial and FRU appliances at the incident and charged at the current Brigade hourly rate.


```{r, parse_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# what type is variable incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue`
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

# readr::parse_number() will convert any numerical values stored as characters into numbers
animal_rescue <- animal_rescue %>% 

  # we use mutate() to use the parse_number() function and overwrite the same variable
  mutate(incident_notional_cost = parse_number(incident_notional_cost))

# incident_notional_cost from dataframe `animal_rescue` is now 'double' or numeric
typeof(animal_rescue$incident_notional_cost)

```

```{r, stats_on_incident_cost,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

animal_rescue %>% 
  
  # group by animal_group_parent
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  
  # filter resulting data, so each group has at least 6 observations
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  
  # summarise() will collapse all values into 3 values: the mean, median, and count  
  # we use na.rm=TRUE to make sure we remove any NAs, or cases where we do not have the incident cos
  summarise(mean_incident_cost = mean (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            median_incident_cost = median (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            sd_incident_cost = sd (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            min_incident_cost = min (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            max_incident_cost = max (incident_notional_cost, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n()) %>% 
  
  # sort the resulting data in descending order. You choose whether to sort by count or mean cost.
  arrange(desc(mean_incident_cost))

```

From the comparison of the mean and median of each group, we can see that the incident cost for Horse is relatively higher than other animal groups. The cost for cat is relatively lower instead.\
Among all the animal groups, we found an outlier in dogs group with the minimum incident cost of 0, which lowers down the mean incident cost for the dog group.


```{r, plots_on_incident_cost_by_animal_group,message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# base_plot
base_plot <- animal_rescue %>% 
  group_by(animal_group_parent) %>% 
  filter(n()>6) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=incident_notional_cost))+
  facet_wrap(~animal_group_parent, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()

base_plot + geom_histogram()
base_plot + geom_density()
base_plot + geom_boxplot()
base_plot + stat_ecdf(geom = "step", pad = FALSE) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)



```

I think the distribution histogram best communicates the variability of the `incident_notional_cost` values, as we can see clearly how it distributes from the graph.\
From the graph, we can tell that horses are more expensive to rescue than other animals. The cost of most cases of horses is around 1000, and some of the cases indicates costs around 2000-3000. While other animals like rabbit, hamster, squirrel, ferret, and cat, the incident cost of these animal groups are more centered in the range of 200-400, which is relatively lower. These animals are cheaper to rescue instead.
